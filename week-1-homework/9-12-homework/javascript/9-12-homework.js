const daniel = ["Daniel", 186, "Dallas"];
const ryan = ["Ryan", 65, "Denver"];


// Daniel decides that Shahzad can't be named "Shahzad" anymore.
 // Remove "Shahzad" from the shahzad array and replace it with "Gameboy".

// Daniel just had his birthday; change Daniel's array to reflect him
// being a year older. Don't just hard code 187--pretend that you don't
// know that his age is 186, and write your code to just make him a year
// older than whatever age he was.

// Ryan is Batman maybe. Or possibly Robin. Change Ryan's
// hometown from "Denver" to "Gotham City".

// Reuben left Durham 5 years ago to come to Chicago. Remove "Durham"
// from Reuben's array and add "Chicago". (Note: remove and then add is different
  // from simply changing the value at that index.)

// Jim could be literally anywhere in the world. Remove "All cities" from his
// array, then pick any 3 cities you like, and add them to Jim's array. If you
// did it in 3 lines of code that's fine, but see if you can do it in one line of code
