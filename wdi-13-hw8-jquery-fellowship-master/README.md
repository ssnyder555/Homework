## Learning Objectives

- Practice using jQuery to manipulate the DOM

---
We are going to take a trip from the Shire, through Rivendell, across Middle
Earth, and into the heart of Mordor itself, Mount Doom. Pack up, because we're
going on an adventure.

## Setup

1. You will be writing your answers inside the `app.js` file located in the folder from this repo: `lotr_homework/js/app.js`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to test your work. It is located at: `lotr_homework/index.html`

## Resources
1. Inside the folder `lotr_homework` folder are an `index.html` file and an a `style.css` sheet that will add some structure and style to your homework.
2. **You will be coding in the `app.js` file.**
3. You will be doing a _tiny_ bit of work in the CSS file once you get to Chapter 9.
4. You **should not** touch the HTML file.

## Directions
1. Open the `app.js` file in your text editor.
2. Observe the arrays of people and places and the 13 chapters that have been included.
3. Note that each chapter has a button in your browser with a click handler attached in the html file, and an associated javascript function in app.js.
4. Your job is to **fill in the code inside the JS functions** to get the application working as intended.

:elephant: Remember that you can check your **DOM tree** in the **Elements tab** in the Chrome Console.

## Workflow

Tackle tonight's homework **one function** at a time from start to finish.

1. When you begin, write a console.log inside of the function that you are working on to check that the event listener works when you click the associated button.

2. Write the correct DOM manipulatory code inside the function and check that it
  works.

NOTE: Each function depends on the previous ones, so make sure your function works
before moving on to the next one!

3. Every time you **refresh** the browser, you will have to **click the buttons** one by one
**in order from the beginning** to operate your application. (If really don't want
the popups after you've completed a step, you can check to disable each popup and speed up the process of debugging).

## Commits

Commit your work after each function is complete and working properly
